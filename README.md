# Cassandra Agent Functions
### Motivation
The integration of AI agents with databases, especially with powerful NoSQL databases like Apache Cassandra, opens up a plethora of possibilities for advanced data processing, analysis, and decision-making in real-time. The "cassandra_agent_functions" library aims to bridge the gap between AI agents and Cassandra databases, providing a suite of pre-built functions that facilitate seamless interactions. This library is designed to empower developers to integrate sophisticated data manipulation capabilities into AI-driven applications with minimal effort, enhancing the overall efficiency and performance of these applications.

### Features
- Easy Integration: Simplify the process of connecting AI agents to - Cassandra databases.
- Modular Design: Offers a collection of standalone functions for various database operations, enabling a plug-and-play approach.
- AI-Optimized: Functions are optimized for AI use cases, including data retrieval, transformation, and insertion tailored for AI model consumption.
- Installation (TODO: Provide installation instructions, including pip install cassandra_agent_functions once available.)

### Usage
(TODO: Include basic usage examples demonstrating how to use the library for connecting to Cassandra, retrieving data, applying transformations, and inserting data.)
